# so-ex (student organization stock exchange)

allowing student organizations to raise capital directly from the student body. 
instead of student councils like ASMSU controlling the funds that goto student organizations the money is instead given to students in a fiat currency 
that is only able to be used on so-ex to invest in student organizations at michigan state. 

This gives organizations a direct incentive to add value to the student body and also gives students full control over what organizations should be funded.
